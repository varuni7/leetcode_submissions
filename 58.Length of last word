Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.
 
 def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int

        s=rstrip(s)
        c=0
        for ele in s[::-1]:
            if ele ==' ':
                return c
            c+=1
